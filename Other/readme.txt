Descriptions : Historical data on avocado prices and sales volume in multiple US markets
The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. 
Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. 
Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. 
Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military.
The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. 
The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

Tips Datasets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Descriptions:
Food servers’ tips in restaurants may be influenced by many factors, including the nature of the restaurant, size of the party, and table locations in the restaurant. Restaurant managers need to know which factors
matter when they assign tables to food servers. For the sake of staff morale,they usually want to avoid either the substance or the appearance of unfair treatment of the servers, for whom tips (at least in restaurants in the United
States) are a major component of pay.In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all cus- tomers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990.
The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law, the restaurant offered to seat in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it. Each
record includes a day and time, and taken together, they show the server’s work schedule
